tittertactoe
============

An amazing tic tac toe game that uses minimax.

I made this to play around with Tkinter GUIs, which is not that fun. I also practiced using pytest for the first time. Cool.
## Want to play?!

Run `ttt_ui.py` then click on buttons to try to beat the randomly-playing computer! You can always restart by clicking "New Game". Yaaaaaay!

## How to test

Run `py.test` from project root directory. It is assumed that the tittertactoe package is "importable" in the current virtual environment (i.e. `pip install -e .` in project root) as per these guidelines: https://pytest.org/latest/goodpractises.html#choosing-a-test-layout-import-rules
